                </li>
                <p>HTML is the predominant mark up language for web pages. HTML creates structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text like headings, lists, links, quotes etc. It allows images and objects to be embedded to create interactive forms. It is written as tags surrounded by angle brackets. Scripts in languages like JavaScript can also be loaded.XHTML is a family of XML languages which extend or mirror versions of HTML. It does not allow omission of any tags or use of attribute minimization. XHTML requires that there be an end tag to every start tag and all nested tags must be closed in the right order. For example, while is valid in HTML, it would be required to write in XHTML.</p>

                    <P>Both XML and HTML are used to create webpages and web applications. However, the two are different in many ways. In this article, we shall discuss these points of difference between XML and HTML.

XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language and is used to transport and save data. The focus here is not on displaying or the appearance of the data.
